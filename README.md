Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Client was the Gaming Room, and they wanted to expand thier game Draw It or Lose It to multiple platforms including web and mobile applications to enhance their user base and revenue. The requirements included developing a distributed, web-based application that supports cross-platform functionality, scalability, consistent gameplay, and secure data management​.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I outlined the software's requirements, design constraints, and architecture, ensuring a clear understanding of the game's expansion needs. I provided a detailed evaluation of operating platforms and development tools. I provided a comprehensive recommendation that aligns with the client’s business objectives.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through a design document was helpful in organizing the software’s requirements, constraints, and architecture. It helped to orginize the coding process to help make it easier to translate abstract requirements into concrete implemention steps. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the evaluation of potentional development tools and frameworks to make it more detailed by exploring specific tools' advantages and limitations, making the selection process more informed and targeted.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on cross-platform support, scalability, and consistent gameplay, integrating these needs into the software architecture. Understanding and implementing user needs ensures the final product aligns with business goals, user satisfaction, and successful deployment.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached designing the software by considering platform compatibility, security, and scalability. In the future, I would employ strategies like user-centered design, iterative prototyping, and regular feedback loops to better analyze and design software applications, ensuring they meet evolving user needs.
